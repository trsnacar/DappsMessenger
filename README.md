# DappsMessenger
With the contract we created with ERC-20 based Solidity, we keep the messaging on the blockchain.

The purpose of a smart contract for a decentralized messaging application on the Ethereum blockchain is to provide a secure and decentralized platform for storing and sending messages.

A smart contract is a piece of code running on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to perform certain actions or transactions in a transparent and verifiable way. In the case of a decentralized messaging application, the smart contract defines the functions and rules for sending and receiving messages on the blockchain, such as who is allowed to send messages and how messages are stored on the blockchain.

The advantage of using a smart contract for a decentralized messaging app is that it provides a secure and tamper-proof platform for storing and sending messages. Because messages are stored on the blockchain, they are immutable and cannot be deleted or altered by any entity. This makes the messages reliable and trustworthy and can be used in applications where the integrity and security of messages is important.
